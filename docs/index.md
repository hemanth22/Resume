#### challenges solved  

**Problem Statement**  

We have production where it generate around 10GB of file, which contains financial data,  
but there is a sequencing logic for inside file which was failing to manage sequencing inside the file.  
So it is difficult to open the file change sequence manually.  


**Solution**  

- To solve this issue, i have written a python program to change the sequencing logic in the 10GB file and save it.  
- As per project requirement, i have learnt dotnet and re-written the logic in dotnet program and implemented in production.  


**Problem Statement**  

Once there was a production issue, there was huge difference between number of lines and filesize of data from previous and current month.  
Upstreams application don't have any option to check on the difference of the file.  
We have to check manually as per the Finance team request, or else it will impacting Monthly regulatory reporting.  

**Solution**  

- I have created a python program that will compare the data between last working day of the last month data and last working of the current month data folders
- sends difference of data through mail to upstream to confirm, if data quality difference is fine
- if fine, we will integrate upstream data, or else upstream will verify the data again.

**Problem Statement**  

On daily basis, we send multiple files to file transfer system (i.e. UI created with IBM SFG),  
through this portal, we can see number of files are sent and timing details,  
but it display 10 records only at once, but we want to check 150 files at once.  

**Solution**  

- I have created a python program to create a daily end of the day report, to connect to file transfer system
- get the data from file transfer system, but response will be in json format
- we parse the json data into table format in regional wise and final mail is sent to our team.

**Problem Statement**  

We have few critical jobs in production, we need to check manually in autosys UI,  
due to some code issue, job doesn't fail properly and it will be in running state in autosys UI,  
even the fix is applied behavior job is still same, but it need to be verified on daily basis.  

**Solution**  

- For this issue, i have written a lucence query, that will fetch the jobs status from elasticsearch 
- creates a report in mail and sends mail specific intervals of time and end of day report.

**Problem Statement**  

We get files from upstream which contains critical data for processing of daily end of month report for india regulatory reporting.  
But sometime upstreams sent zero data files and half processed files which was creating accounting reconciliation breaks for end of month.  

**Solution**  

- First we took average file size which we recieve from upstream every month.
- Using autosys, we have create a filewatcher to monitor zero data and  
  partial data file size and fail it to prevent data integration and get an alert to the team
